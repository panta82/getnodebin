# getnodebin

Very simple script to install node binary distributions on local system. 

## Usage

```
./install.sh 6.0.0 /home/user/local
```

Leave out the path to target `/usr/local`.

## Stability

I use this script personally, but it's not all that well tested at the moment. 
It's doing a lot of `rm`-s, so there's definitely a risk of data or time loss.
